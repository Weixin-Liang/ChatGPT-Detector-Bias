Adversarial training is a machine learning technique in which a model is trained on adversarial examples, i.e., inputs that are deliberately designed to cause the model to make errors. We investigate the use of adversarial training in two QA models: a baseline BiDAF architecture and a more complex model that uses attention and self-attention mechanisms. Our experiments show that adversarial training can significantly improve the robustness of both models, reducing their error rates on adversarial examples by up to 70%. We also demonstrate that adversarial training can improve the performance of the models on real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the SQuAD v2.0 benchmark."

        "document": "This final report presents a novel approach to semi-supervised learning in question-answering tasks with data augmentation. The proposed method, named Probability-Mixing, combines the outputs of a supervised model and a self-training model to generate more accurate predictions. The self-training model is trained on unlabeled data using data augmentation techniques to generate more diverse examples. The Probability-Mixing method leverages the strengths of each model by assigning weight to the predicted output of each model based on their predicted probabilities. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the Probability-Mixing method outperforms most of the existing methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score, highlighting its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning for question-answering tasks."

        "document": "\n\nThe SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) is a challenging task and the attention mechanism has become a popular technique for its solution. One of the proposed models for SQuAD is the Gated Self-Attention (GSA) model. The GSA utilizes a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) to encode the contexts and query-words into a sequence of hidden states. These states are then used to calculate the self-attention matrix, and the query-aware context representation. The result of the GSA is then passed through a linear layer to obtain the final answers. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the GSA model on the SQuAD dataset and provide insights into the performance, limitations, and possible future directions for improvement. Our experiments show that the GSA model reaches competitive results in terms of accuracy and speed compared to previous approaches."

The study revisits the QANet architecture and investigates three variations of the model: the original QANet, QANet with an additional input-channel attention mechanism, and QANet with one-dimensional (1D) convolutional layers. The experiments were conducted on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, which contains unanswerable questions in addition to the answerable ones, making the task more challenging. The results show that the 1D-convolutional-QANet achieved the best performance, outperforming the original QANet and the attention variant. The findings suggest that the combination of self-attention and 1D convolutions can effectively capture temporal features and improve the performance of question answering models on complex datasets like SQuAD 2.0."
