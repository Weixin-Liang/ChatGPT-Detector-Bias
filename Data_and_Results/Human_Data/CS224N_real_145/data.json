Many of the deep-learning based question answering systems are trained and evaluated on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), where the answer to every question is either unanswerable or a segment of text from the corresponding reading passage [4]. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of different embeddings in improving the performance of the baseline Bi-Directional Attention Flow model on solving SQuAD 2.0. The first model improves upon the baseline with character-level embeddings; the second model improves with subword-level embeddings; the third improves with both character-level and subword-level embeddings. Our best model, which incorporates word-level and subword-level embeddings, achieves an EM score of 57.70 and F1 score of 61.26 on the test set."

However, despite recent advances in QA modeling, these systems still struggle to generalize to a specific domain without specialized training data and information about that domain's distribution. For this reason, we investigated the effectiveness of different data augmentation and sampling techniques to improve the robustness of the pre-trained DistilBERT QA system on out of domain data. We trained the DistilBERT model on the in domain data and then experimented with fine-tuning using augmented versions of the out of domain data. To generate the additional data-points we performed random word deletion, synonym replacement, and random swapping. We found that all the fine-tuned models performed better than the baseline model. Additionally, we found that our optimal synonym replacement model performed the best on the out of domain test set, and that the combination model of synonym replacement and deletion also led to increased performance over the baseline. Overall, we conclude that data augmentation does increase the ability of our question answering system to generalize to out of domain data and suggest that future work could look further into applying combinations of these data augmentation techniques."

Yet, these same superhuman models often do not perform well on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets or tasks. In contrast, humans appear to easily and quickly generalize to new unseen domains. In this project, we aim to train a QA model that is able to perform well across different datasets, especially on OOD datasets. Specifically, we experiment with the use of adversarial training applied to a pretrained DistiIBERT model. The adversarial training takes the form of a critic model that tries to classify the origin domain of the QA embedding. In addition to the regular QA loss, the QA model has the additional objective of fooling the critic model. This encourages the QA model to learn a domain-agnostic embedding, which we hope to help with generalization and robustness to OOD datasets."

After experiments with different models and modifications, both BiDAF and QANet outperform the baseline model, with QANet being our best model. It takes some advantages of various features in other modifications mentioned before, and it consists of four layers: (1) Embedding layer where the combination of character-level and word-level embedding uses the pre-trained word embedding model to map the input into vector space. (2) Contextual embedding layer where the encoder block utilized contextual cues from surrounding words to refine the embedding of the words. (3) Attention flow layer where the coattention-like implementation produces a set of query-aware feature vectors for each word in the context. (4) Modeling and output layer where a stack of encoder blocks with fully-connected layers are sued to scan the context and provide an answer to the query.

In particular, the mechanism is what is called a fine-grained gating method, in which, given a character level embedding $c$ and a word-level embedding $w$, a parameter $g$ is learned such that final embedding of a given word is $g \\odot c + (1-g) \\odot w$, where $\\odot$ represents termwise multiplication. After various experiments varying the methods by which the parameter $g$ is learned, results ultimately show that none of the fine-tuned gating methods perform better than mere concatenation of the word and character embeddings."

We explore the efficacy of this technique as well as the scope of what can be considered a \"domain\" and how the choice of domains affects the performance of the trained model.

The baseline model, which finetunes DistilBERT on SQuAD, NewsQA, and Natural Questions datasets, achieves an EM score of 33.25 and F1 score of 48.43 when validated on the out-of-sample DuoRC, RACE, and RelationExtraction datasets. Applying TAPT to the out-of-domain unlabeled training datasets using masked language modeling (MLM) without data augmentation, we do not observe an increase in either metric of performance. However, not using TAPT, our model performance is enhanced when we use backtranslations to augment only a small portion of the training data for finetuning, achieving an EM of 36.91 and F1 score of 50.16 on the out of domain validation set. This model also achieves an EM of 41.628 and F1 of 58.91 on the out of domain test set.

We train a single DistilBERT model in three phases (shown in the flowchart). First, during TAPT, we pretrain with masked-language modeling (MLM) on our QA datasets. Second, we fine-tune on our QA data. We employ domain sampling during both pretraining and fine-tuning, which preferably samples data that lead to better downstream performance. Finally, for our data augmentations, we use synonym replacement and random deletion to increase the size and variety of our out-domain data, before additionally fine-tuning on these augmented data. During evaluation, we found significant EM/F1 performance improvements by fine-tuning on augmented out-domain data. We found modest, yet non-trivial, performance improvements with TAPT and domain sampling. Using these three techniques, our model achieved EM/F1 scores of 37.44/51.37 on the development set and 40.12/58.05 on the test set."

Our results show improvements over the baseline on average, although the model exhibited worse performance on certain datasets.

Secondly, the QANet model was re-implemented from scratch and successfully explored some hyperparameter finetunings to improve performance.\nThe improved BiDAF model (SA-BiDAF++) incorporating self-attention, achieved 65.3 EM / 68.8 F1 scores on the test set of the SQuAD 2.0.

This project demonstrated that EM, F1 and AvNA scores can be improved on a BiDAF model simply by pretraining on a similar task to that used in the original BERT paper. While the BERT paper used a Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Predictions (NSP), this paper utilizes a novel variant of MLM, termed Obscured Replacement Language Model (ORLM), to enable the strict input-output mappings of a BiDAF model to learn from an unsupervised task. Specifically, this paper shows that performance gains over the baseline BiDAF model can be achieved using ORLM, as judged by the EM and F1 scores. Furthermore, pretraining the BiDAF model with this method decreases the amount of training required on the SQuAD 2.0 training dataset to achieve similar performances, while boosting task-specific metrics such as the AvNA score. As the community concretely moves away from LSTM-based architectures, there is room to ask whether the true top-end performance of those architectures was explored, even if they continue to fall short of state-of-the-art."

Is the bi-directional attention layer really necessary in a transformer-style architecture? These are the questions, I tried to answer in this project. Compared to the three baselines derived from the BiDAF model, QANet achieved substantially higher F1 and EM scores of 67.54 and 63.99 respectively. However, these scores are significantly lower than those of the current state-of-the-art models, mainly because the model couldn't correctly handle unanswerable questions. Next, experiments with model size showed no performance degradation with smaller-sized QANet variants. In fact, these variants slightly outperformed the base QANet. Lastly, a new model built entirely using QANet's building blocks (without an explicit bi-directional attention layer) outperformed all of the baseline models even without finetuning. Its performance is still below the base QANet model most likely because the model started overfitting roughly midway through training. I believe adding more regularization and further finetuning would bring its performance close to that of the base QANet model."

While the parallel nature of QANet's CNN architecture allows for a significant speed boost, it means that minimizing GPU memory usage is crucial to attain these benefits. In this report we perform an exhaustive study investigating changes to spatial complexity, speed, and performance on the QANet architecture by replacing components in the encoder block with memory-efficient alternatives such as LSH Self Attention, reversible residual networks, and reformer blocks. The image above depicts the QANet encoder block where the self-attention and feed-forward layer are replaced with a reformer, a stack of reversible LSH Self Attention and feed-forward layers. We found that implementing LSH attention successfully decreased memory usage on long sequences while maintaining reasonable performance.

We adjust a pre-trained DistilBERT model such that it leverages datasets with large amounts of training data to achieve higher question-answering performance on datasets with very small amounts of available training data using a novel inner- and outer-layer Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach.\n\nPractically, we first connect pre-trained DistilBERT models and an MoE layer in sequence (inner-layer) and train them on all high-availability data and on a single dataset with low data availability. Then we use several of these DistilBERT-MoE models in parallel to predict observations from multiple datasets with low data availability (outer-layer). We find that the noise reduction achieved by training designated DistilBERT-MoE models for different datasets with low data availability yields greater prediction benefits than the (possibly) increased transfer learning effects achieved by training a single DistilBERT-MoE model on all high- and low-availability datasets together. Both our inner-outer-MoE method and a single DistilBERT-MoE model outperform the baseline provided by a finetuned DistilBERT model, suggesting that the mixture of experts approach is a fruitful venue to enabling robust predictions in contexts with few training examples."

One of the most difficult areas for current models is generalization. While humans can easily generalize beyond a training data set, computers often have difficulty developing non-superficial correlations beyond the provided data. In this project, we tackled this concept of computer generalization through the development of a robust question answering (QA) system that is able to generalize answers to questions from out-of-domain (OOD) input. Here, we applied a modified Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where gating and expert training are handled seperately, over the 6 datasets in order to create robustness through specialization of the various expert models. We also applied few-sample fine-tuning to large and small components of the model to try to better account and generalize for cases where there is little data. Ultimately, from the results of the model, we observed that this modified MoE architecture has several limitations through its expert and training method and was unable to improve significantly on the baseline of the model. In addition, we also observed that the few-sample fine-tuning techniques greatly improved the performance of the small, out-of-domain expert but barely improved, and sometimes harmed, models with a larger dataset. As a whole, this paper illustrates the potential limitations of applying a simple MoE model and few-sample fine-tuning to the complex task of generalization and may suggest the implementation of more advanced structures and techniques are necessary for strong performance."

In this work, we build upon the default bidirectional attention flow model and explore the effect of adding character embeddings, self-attention, and a weighted loss function compared with the baseline. While character embeddings and self-attention have been demonstrated to improve the performance of language models, the motivation for a weighted loss function comes from the nature of the SQuAD dataset itself. We note that about half of the samples of the SQUAD dataset have no-answer, and is thus denoted by a start and end-pointer value of zero. Because the problem is effectively being treated as a classification problem (where the pointer locations are the classes to be predicted), this results in a ground truth distribution that is heavily skewed toward start and end-pointer class 0. To address this imbalance, we also propose the use of a weighted loss function, which down-weights no-answer examples, discouraging the model from simply guessing no-answer as a default choice. With a combined model, we achieve 62.11 EM and 65.54 F1 on the test set. We discover that a great deal of the error of the model comes from false-positives, and over-reliance on token matching."

The task is called Question Answering (QA) and is the focus of this paper where we explore our idea to enhance an existing solution called BiDAF (Seo et al, 2016). Our intuition is that language understanding involves at least two broad capabilities. First one has to understand what words individually mean. And second, based on the structure of the sentences one has to make sense of the complete sentence. Individual word are usually represented by word embeddings in most solutions. But the second piece is where different approaches diverge greatly. To address this part, we were interested  to see, if syntactic information  can help. Specifically, we explored the idea of using dependency parse trees (DPT) to enrich the embedding of individual words. DPT provides a representation of syntactic relationships between words in a sentence. We defined the relationship between words as the path between them in the dependency tree. We hypothesized that even though grammatical structure doesn't enable a system to do a lot of things such as reasoning, the best a model could do with a limited dataset is to learn the patterns between syntax of questions with that of the answer phrases. This inspired us to augment the input word embeddings to the model with dependency parse tree based information. Our model  not only scored significantly higher (+7% on F1 & EM) compared to the baseline, it also learned almost twice as fast even with the extra preprocessing time. DPTs are produced by deep learning model, so end to end there is in no manual feature engineering.

The BiDAF modifications which added character embeddings achieved a small, but significant improvement over the baseline model on the test set. However, the QANet models only nearly matched the baseline BiDAF scoring with character embeddings. Curiously, not only did my QANet under-perform the baseline in model performance, it also turned out to be significantly slower to train and at inference time on GPUs. Though profiling, I found that the QANet model is indeed faster on CPUs, however significantly under-performs the baseline BiDAF model on GPUs because the BiDAF model's slowest component, the RNN, is implemented as a highly optimized CuDNN routine on GPUs that the custom QANet encoder block did not benefit from. Finally, this profiling also shows that faster attention mechanisms, as explored in the literature, are unlikely to improve performance on this particular SQuAD 2.0 workload as additional instruction overhead would likely wash out any performance gains absent better operation compilation for GPUs or a custom GPU kernel."

However, recent developments in neural networks have yielded significant strides in how well computers are able to answer abstract questions; concepts like dynamic coattention and character level embeddings have helped machines with abstract tasks like reading comprehension. Despite these strides, training models utilizing these techniques remains cumbersome and exceedingly time consuming.\n\nWe explored a handful of different approaches on improving the SQuAD evaluation score within the context of coattention models. Immediately, we noticed character-level embeddings increase evaluation metrics by a few points and decided to explore coattention models with character-level embeddings. The performance of our coattention models without a dynamic decoder performed significantly worse than the baseline. We noted how removing the modeling layer reduced the training time in half while achieving a similar performance.\n\nWe hypothesized that the coattention model did not perform as well because the character-level embeddings introduced unnecessary and irrelevant similarities between the question and context embedding. Furthermore, we noted that there were some variance in the training runs especially in the F1 score. Some potential avenues for future work can explore  removing character-level embeddings, reintroducing a dyamic decoder and observing the performance between a coattention model with and without a modeling layer to see if there are still improvements in training time. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to further explore the QANet model to understand how they intended to improve on training time."

We explored performance after adding character level embeddings to the baseline along with exploring various attention mechanisms. Additionally, we also explored the impact of tuning the hyper-parameters used to train the model. Finally, we studied the effect of using multiple variants of RNN as building blocks in the neural architecture. We improved the model performance on both dev and test sets by at least 4 points. The baseline F1 and EM scores without character embedding were 60.65 and 57.13 while our best improvements with BiDAF, Character Embedding, Self-attention with LSTM were 65.80 and 62.99 respectively. The scores would have been better with pre-trained models however, for our track it was prohibited.

Sometimes, the resource of certain QA tasks is limited. Our work aims to build a robust QA system that can generalize to novel QA tasks with few examples and gradient steps. We propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style training framework, where we learn a gating network to construct the embeddings by performing a weighted sum of the base \"expert\" models with fixed parameters. We find that using the mixture of expert models improves generalization performance and reduces overfitting, especially when using \"expert\" models trained with data augmentation. We use meta-learning methods, specifically the MAML algorithm, to train the gating network for domain adaptation. Training the gating network with the MAML algorithm and finetuning on out-of-domain tasks improved out-of-domain QA performance of baseline models on all metrics. We also discovered a correlation between expert-model performance and the weight the MoE framework puts on each of them. Our approach achieves a F-1 score of 60.8 and EM score of 42.2 on the out-of-domain QA testing leaderboard."

Our addition of self-matching attention in BiDAF matches the question-aware passage representation against itself. It dynamically collects evidence from the whole passage and encodes the evidence relevant to the current passage word. In QANet, convolution and self-attention are building blocks of encoders that separately encode the query and the context. Our implementation of multihead attention in QANet, ran through the attention mechanism several times in parallel. The independent attention outputs are then concatenated and linearly transformed into the expected dimension. Multiple attention heads allow for attending to parts of the sequence differently, so longer-term dependencies are also taken into account, not just shorter-term dependencies.\n\nWe saw some interesting trends while doing Qualitative error analysis of our output. Model was able to answer \"who\" questions better than \"what\" questions. When the \"what\" question was framed differently, like \u201cEconomy, Energy and Tourism is one of the what?\u201d Even though the passage contains the answer, the model could not predict. Also, we observed wrong predictions in general  for questions involving relationships, like: \"Who was Kaidu's grandfather?\" The passage did not mention it explicitly \"Kaidu's grandfather was ...\", however it had the clue: \"Ogedei's  grandson Kaidu ...\", but it could not interpret the correct answer from the passage and instead provided a wrong answer. We also noticed the model could not predict at all a lot of \"which\" questions. Further analysis revealed that those \"which\" questions require a bit more contextual understanding. It was a good learning experience and the model prediction provided a lot of clues as to how we can improve the model to the next level."

Our goal in this project is to build a question answering system that can adapt to new domains with very few training data from the target domain. We conduct experiments on three different techniques: 1) data augmentation, 2) task-adaptive pretraining (TAPT), and 3) multi-task finetuning to tackle the problem of producing a QA system that is robust to out-of-domain samples.  We found that simply augmenting the in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) training samples available to us, specifically using insertions, substitutions, swaps and back-translations, boosted our model performance with just the baseline model architecture significantly. Further pretraining using the masked LM objective on the few OOD training samples also proved to be helpful for improving generalization. We also explored various model architectures in the realm of multi-task learning and found that jointly optimizing the QA loss with MLM loss allowed the model to generalize on the OOD samples significantly, confirming existing literature surrounding multi-task learning. Hoping that these gains from data augmentation, adaptive pretraining, and multi-task learning would be additive, we tried combining the techniques but found that the sum of the techniques performed only slightly better and sometimes worse than the smaller underlying systems alone. Our best model implements data augmentation on both ID and OOD train datasets with the DistilBERT base model and achieved EM/F1 scores of 35.34/51.58 on the OOD dev set and 42.32/60.17 on the held-out test set.

To overcome this, In our paper, we proposed ALP-Net to build a robust question answering system that can adapt to new tasks with few-shot learning using answer length penalty, data augmentation, adversarial training and meta learning.\n1. First, We proposed a new answer length penalty that penalizes the model if the predicted answer is too long, as the baseline QA model tends to generate very long answers. This simple optimization is proved to be very effective in shortening the answers and improving Exact Match.\n2. We also applied data augmentation to generate new data for low-resource datasets by doing synonym replacement and word addition. With data augmentation, the model is more unlikely to learn brittle features such as the occurrences of certain words and fixed answer positions, leading to improved F1.\n3. ALP-Net also adopted adversarial training. We applied a discriminator to determine whether the features learned by the model are domain specific. With adversarial learning, models can learn domain agnostic features that could be applied to unseen domains. We found that while being effective in the few-shot learning task, adversarial training should not be used on out-of-domain training data to keep its domain knowledge.\n4. We also tried meta learning to adopt the mean of different sets of model parameters learned from data of different domains. However, it did not perform well and we found that it is hard to learn general knowledge across domains for question answering tasks.\nAmong these approaches, data augmentation and answer length penalty contribute the most to our model performance, allowing us to achieve 60.962 F1 and 43.005 EM score on out-of-domain datasets test data."

For this task, given a paragraph and a related question, the machine's model must select the span from the paragraph that corresponds to the answer using a start index prediction and end index prediction.  My baseline model for this task is a Bidirectional Attention Flow (BiDAF) end-to-end neural network, with embedding, encoder, attention, modeling and output layers. Significantly, the output layer involves the probability distribution of the start index token and end index token to be generated independently. However, in order for the model to learn how the end of an answer can depend on the start of an answer, I implement a boundary model of an Answer Pointer layer (introduced by Wang et al, 2017) based on the notion of a Pointer Network (Vinyals et al, 2015) as a replacement for the output layer of the baseline. This enables us to condition the prediction for the end token on the prediction for the start token of the answer in the input text. Further, since a Pointer Network outputs a probability distribution exclusively over locations in the input paragraph (context) at each step instead of outputting a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, it allows us to improve the model's efficiency in addition to its accuracy. On testing this new model, I obtain an F1 score of 59.60 and an EM score of 55.01 on the development set, which is an improvement on the performance of the baseline - involving both F1 and EM scores of 52.19 on the development set."

We think that each of them leads in some way to an intuitive representation of language, linking it to larger aims within the field. Surprisingly, the coattention and self-attention modified models each score comparatively to or below the baseline model. Perhaps this hints at the importance of multiple layers for self-attention and word-to-word token interactions, as we only used one layer and a vectorized form of the original RNet self-attention paper. Our character-level embeddings + Answer-Pointer modified BiDAF performs best, scoring EM: 60.23 and F1: 63.56 on the dev set and EM: 58.715 and F1: 62.283 on the test set (compared to the baseline model with EM: 56.61 and F1: 60.24 on the dev set).

To address this problem, domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt models trained for a task on in-domain datasets to a target domain by using efficiently samples from the latter. On the contrary, domain generalization techniques aim to incentivate the model to learn domain-invariant features directly from in-domain data to generalize the model for any out-of-domain dataset, pushing to learn task-relevant features and preventing overfitting on in-domain data. We like to compare this approach the way humans learn a task, as they can generally perform the same task on different domains from only a few examples. However, domain generalization is often performed by augmenting in-domain data by applying semantic-preserving transformations to challenge the model during training, leveraging some kind of rules or domain knowledge. Contrarily, in this project our goal is to explore domain generalization techniques applied to question answering based on adversarial training without leveraging any set of rules or domain knowledge but using adversarial terms to make more robust the regular loss with or without adopting task-agnostic critic networks. Such extremely general methodology does not suffer from the limitations of synonym replacement approaches and can be applied to other NLP tasks.

Our method also augments the out-of-domain dataset from which demonstrations are sampled using backtranslation to generate in-distribution training examples. We find that the basic approach of simply appending randomly sampled out-of-domain demonstrations to in-domain contexts does not improve model F1 and EM score performance, but supplementing this approach by adding separator tokens between each demonstration and augmenting the out-of-domain training dataset using backtranslation improves model performance."

Ensembling our best models by majority vote achieved validation set F1 and EM scores over 7 points higher than the baseline with comparable test set performance (F1=68.753, EM=65.714).

Thus, the goal for our project was to build a question answering system that is robust to distributional shift. Utilizing a pretrained DistilBERT model as our baseline, we tested two adaptation methods: backtranslation and few-sample fine-tuning. Backtranslation, which involves translating input data into an intermediate language before translating back to the original language, is a common data augmentation technique in many NLP tasks.  We found that implementing standard backtranslation on out-of-domain training examples yielded significant increases in Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores over our baseline model. We compared these results to several modified backtranslation schemes including one in which we combined backtranslation with techniques from few-sample fine-tuning. Ultimately, we found that combining few-sample fine-tuning techniques with backtranslation did not improve performance. Our best model achieved an EM of 42.225 and F1 of 59.162 on the test set, and an EM of 38.74 and F1 of 51.19 on the development set."

Our results showed that adding this secondary objective resulted in meaningful improvements in both EM and F1 over our implementation of QANet, which mostly follows the official QANet but we added a project layer on the output of the context-query attention layer to reduce memory usage.

We hypothesize that this issue is not primarily caused by the pre-trained model's limitations, but rather by the lack of diverse training data that might convey important contextual information in the fine-tuning stage. We explore several methods to augment standard training data with syntactically informative data, generated by randomly replacing the grammatical tense of data, removing words associated with gender, race, or economic means, and only replacing question sentences with synonym words from a lexicon of words. We found that the augmentation method that performed the best was changing the grammar of more and one word in every question. Although it only made less than 1 point increase in the F1 and EM scores, we believe that if we also applied this method to the context and answers training data we would be able to see even more significant improvements. We were also surprised that the method of removing associations with gender, race, or economic status performed relatively well given that we removed a lot of words from the dataset."

This is problematic since real-world applications require models to adapt to inputs coming from previously unseen distributions. In this paper, we discuss our attempt to create a robust system for extractive question answering (QA). We use a BERT variant as our baseline, and attempt four methods to improve upon it. Our first method is a model that uses the Mixture-Of-Experts (MoE) technique described in the \"Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts\" paper and the Robust QA Default Project handout. The second is an original inference-time procedure which predicts the answer span that maximizes the expected F1 score. The third approach is to produce more out-of-domain training examples via data-augmentation. Our final and best-performing method is an Adversarial Training model described in \"Domain-agnostic Question-Answering with Adversarial Training\". The MoE model and expected-F1-maximization strategy fail to outperform the baseline's F1 score of 47.098, achieving F1 scores of 44.870 and 44.706  on the validation set respectively. Training the baseline with augmented data produces an F1 score of 48.04.

The last area of exploration is an altered loss function that biases against length. Our main conclusions support that fine tuning and data augmentation methods were the most critical in improving performance on question answering systems under domain shifts. We see that data augmentation (back translation and synonym translation) however can sometimes be too noisy depending on how many sequences of languages we filter through, suggesting that future work looks into understanding an optimal number of languages. We have inconclusive results on the quality of MLM and upsampling our dataset as we see marginal improvement at best from these methods, potentially suggesting that they are not worthwhile pursuing for such few sample finetuning.

The goal of our project is thus to build a question answering system that is robust to out-of-distribution datasets. We approach this challenge through data augmentation, where we hope to add label preserving invariances to the fine-tuning procedure to reduce the learned features specific to the in-domain data while increasing the number of the out-of-domain data that our QA model can generalize more broadly. Specifically, we paraphrased both the in-domain and out-of-distribution training sets by back-translating each query and context pair to multiple languages (Spanish, Russian, and German) using architectures that include a two-layer neural machine translation (NMT) system and pretrained language transformers. After back-translation, we iterate over all continuous subsets of words in the context sentence to find an approximate answer span that is the most similar to the original gold answer, and we filtered out examples with Generalized Jaccard similarity scores below 0.65 to ensure data quality.

Few shot learning is an important goal in creating generalizable neural network models. In this paper we explore ways to increase the few shot learning performance of a model by implementing a few variations meant to improve generalizability; specifically we measure the effects of data augmentation and mixture of experts on a pre-trained transformer BERT model. Mixture of experts is a technique in which separate models are trained to be responsible for different sub tasks within a problem. We find that this change is able to remove the interference between out-of-domain datasets during training and increase performance from F1 48.43 to 51.54. Data augmentation applied for NLP is a technique in which words within a piece of text are added, removed, or replaced in an effort to increase the variance in training data.

In traditional transformers, there exists an upper dependency length limit equal to the length of this context. The Transformer-XL addresses these issues by caching the representations of previous segments to be reused as additional context to future segments, thus increasing the context size and allowing information to flow from one segment to the next. This longer-term dependency capture can be particularly useful when applying transformers to domains outside of natural language. Only a small improvement is shown with the Transformer-XL / QANet combined model compared to the baseline BIDAF, but increased performance is expected with additional parameter finetuning."

We identify the shortcomings of this model and implement a multi-stage hierarchical end-to-end network that solves the shortcomings of BiDAF.\n\nMore specifically, the original model uses a sequence-to-sequence network like RNN to encode information of query/context into a vector. Even though RNNs' are known to be quite effective, they have few huge bottlenecks, namely, non-parallelizability of the network due to its seq-to-seq/time-step based computation, lack of transfer learning support, and vulnerability to vanishing/exploding gradient. We handle these shortcomings of RNN by replacing them with transformer encoders.\n\nAdditionally, we implement few recent techniques to improve the vanilla encoder network, namely, Spatial Positional Encoding instead of traditional Absolute Positional Encoding, ScaleNorm instead of traditional LayerNorm, Feedforward Network with Gated Linear Unit instead of traditional Feedforward Network with RELU.\n\nLooking outside RNN, we replace the query-to-context and context-to-query Attention flow with Cross-Attention using a Multi-headed Attention mechanism. We show that multi-headed Cross-Attention works better than the traditional Attention Flow layer.\n\nFinally, we introduce pre-trained character embedding vectors that were extrapolated from the existing Glove pre-trained word embeddings. We also show that this improves the baseline BiDAF model by a considerable amount.\n\nLastly, we show the results of our final model on the validation set and compare its performance with the baseline BiDAF model. Evidently, we can observe that our model is performing better than the original BiDAF in terms of latency, and accuracy. Our Model is also highly extensible since we use encoders and multi-head attention and they don't suffer from traditional seq-to-seq bottlenecks and are available to the use of transfer learning."

For these reasons, we focused on implementing various models that concern primarily the embedding layer and attention layers.

After hyperparameter tuning, I found this improved performance by an additional 3.5 points on all scoring metrics.\nIn Phase 3, I replaced the Transformer with an architectural variant, the Performer, which aims to solve the issue of quadratic scaling in vanilla Transformers'runtime and memory usage by using kernel methods to approximate the self-attention calculation. I found that this was effective within QANet, enabling linear scaling from hundreds to tens of thousands of tokens, with minimal impact to performance.\nIn Phase 4, I prepared to make use of this scale to support open-domain question answering. I wrote a TF-IDF based document retriever, which returned the most similar Wikipedia page to the current context passage. I found this to be reasonably effective in locating similar passages.\nFinally, in Phase 5, I fed this new input into QANet via a new, large Background input, which supplemented the existing Context and Question inputs.

One avenue for improvement is augmenting the training dataset to include new patterns that may help the model generalize outside of its original dataset. In this paper, we explore improving model robustness in the question-answering task, where we have a query, a context (i.e. passage), and an answer span that selects a portion of the context. We utilize various data augmentation techniques including adding noise to our contexts and backtranslating (translating text to a pivot language and then back) both the queries and contexts. We find that leveraging the technique of backtranslation on the queries, both on in-domain and out-of-domain training datasets, greatly improves model robustness and gives a 3.7% increase in F1 scores over our baseline model without data augmentation. Further, within this approach of backtranslation, we explore the linguistic effect of particular pivot languages and find that using Spanish adds the greatest robustness to our model.

Future work includes tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with data processing techniques, adding optimizations like the Adam optimizer, and exploring different forms of attention."

Question answering consists in training models to answer questions provided in natural language from either prodided or general context. The QANet architecture, originally presented in 2018, was a top performer on the original SQuAD dataset before the advent of pre-training. While the original SQuAD dataset only contained answerable questions, the creators of the dataset published the updated SQuAD2.0 dataset that contains unanswerable question and demonstrated that while it had little effect on human performance, it greatly reduced the effectiveness of existing models. We study how the QANet model fair on this dataset compared with a BiDAF baseline model, another high-performing model. We show that QANet's effectiveness drops, but that simple modifications to the original architecture allow significant improvements in overall performance. We also study the benefits of ensembling different architectures to improve final performance. We achieve EM and F1 scores of 63.415 and 66.734 on the test dataset."

BERT is pre-trained using unlabeled natural language data via a masked language model (MLM) method, it is then fine-tuned for next- sentence prediction and question answering tasks.\n\nSuccessfully adapting BERT to low-reource natural language domains remains an open problem. Previous approaches have included using multitask and meta-learning fine-tuning procedures. Using a variant of the Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) algorithm from, researchers were able to show that meta learning procedures had a slight advantage in low-resource domain adaptation than multitask models. However the researchers experimented with only a few task distributions p(T) for the MAML algorithm, and while the results did show an improvement over multitask models, performance for certain task distributions on specific tasks was somewhat counterintuitive.\n\nIn this paper, suggestions from a recent paper in the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) are implemented to stabilize training of a MAML-type algorithm on a pre-trained variant of BERT called DistilBERT. Several task distributions and other MAML-specific hyperparameter initializations are implemented and analyzed and a classifier is trained to predict out-of-domain dataset type to better leverage task-specific fine-tuning. The image included indicates that certain tasks, like predicting for the race and relation extraction datasets, are distinguishable and that a MAML algorithm might not be able to leverage data from one to help the other. However, another task, like predicting on the duorc dataset that is shown to be fairly indistinguishable from the other two datasets, might be able to help the other two tasks out during training."

We explored three areas of improvements: character embeddings, conditioning the end prediction on the start prediction, and adding a self-attention layer. We found that the biggest improvement was from the Condition End Prediction on Start Prediction and Self-Attention with an F1 and EM score of 65.285 and 61.758 on the test set respectively. The model with character embeddings scored a 59.96 on EM and a 63.24 on F1, and the model with character embedding and self attention scored a 63 on EM and a 66.2 on F1 (both for the dev set). In our error analysis, we discovered that generally, all models performed well on questions that began with \"When\", and performed poorly on questions that begin with \"What\" and \"The\".

Specifically, a separate DistilBERT model was finetuned on each of the in-domain datasets to act as an expert. The finetuning approaches focused on reinitializing a variable amount of final transformer blocks and training for a longer period. These two approaches were then synthesized to produce the final model. The results were negative. I speculate that this is because the domains covered by the experts were too distinct from that of the out-of-domain datasets.

In the past few years, the most successful models are primarily based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention. Though a lot of progress has been made, due to its sequential nature, RNN's operations are unparallelizable, which makes both training and inference slow. In addition, with linear interaction distance, RNNs have difficulty in learning long dependencies. This is a severe problem in QA system, since the context are usually long paragraphs.\n\nBased on these problems, in this project, we implemented a QA model based on Transformer, hoping to achieve both accurate and fast reading comprehension. We focused on reading comprehension among all QA problems, which is to select a part of text from the given context to answer some certain question. Instead of LSTM, this model used convolution layers and self-attention to form encoders. Given a paragraph of context and a question, it will output the probability of each context word being the start or end of the answer. However, against our expectation, this model did not perform very well. The speed is low due to its large amount of parameters, and the accuracy cannot match that of BiDAF because of overfitting."

This project seeks to improve the robustness of these QA systems to unseen domains through a combination of Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques.  As baseline, we finetuned a pre-trained DistilBERT model with Natural Questions, NewsQA and SQuAD datasets using the default configurations and evaluated the model performance on the out-of-domain datasets, including RelationExtraction, DuoRC, and RACE. After obtaining our second baseline by including a small number of training examples from our out-of-domain datasets, we ran two rounds of hyperparameters tuning through random search. Based on the best performing set of hyperparameters, we then augmented our out-of-domain datasets using the EDA techniques and analyzed the effects of each technique through a series of experiments. Finally, we implemented an MoE model with three experts and a two-layer bi-directional LSTM followed by a linear layer as the gating function.  Both the data augmentation technique and the mixture-of-expert approach demonstrated capability to improve the robustness of DistilBERT-based QA systems, and a combination of the two methods brings even further improvement. The combined approach increased the F1 and EM scores on the dev set by 15.03% and 14.87%, respectively, compared to the baseline, and achieved an F1 score of 62.062 and an EM score of 42.317 on the test leaderboard."

These large language models are trained on enormous corpus, and it now becomes a question whether they are robust to domain shift. We find in this paper that the domain of question answering (QA) problems has significant impact on the performance of these fine-tuned LMs and these fine-tuned QA models are still sensitive to domain shift during test time. This potentially causes problems in many real-word applications where broad or evolving domains are involved. So, how can we improve model robustness? In this paper, we offer two potential solutions. First, we propose to continue pretraining on the objective domains. This second-phase of pretraining helps model focus on information that is relevant to the problem. We find that domain-adaptive pretraining helps improve out-of-domain test performance. In some cases, we might have additional small amount of training data on the test domain. We propose to use data augmentation tricks to maximally utilize these data for domain adaptation purpose. We find that data augmentation tricks, including synonym replacement, random insertion and random deletion, can further improve the performance on out-of-domain test samples. Our work shows that the improvements in performance from domain-adaptive pretraining and data augmentation are additive. With both methods applied, our model achieves a test performance of 60.731 in F1 score and 42.248 in EM score. The experiments and methods discussed in this paper will contribute to a deeper understanding of LMs and efforts towards building a more robust QA system."

Recurrent models achieved good results using RNNs to process sequential inputs and attention components to cope with long term interactions. However, recurrent QA models have two main weaknesses. First, due to the single-pass nature of the decoder step, models have issues recovering from incorrect local maxima. Second, due to the sequential nature of RNNs these models are often too slow for both training and inference. To address the first problems, we implemented a model based on Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) that incorporates a dynamic decoder that iteratively predicts the answer span. To improve the model efficiency, we also implemented a transformer based recurrency-free model (QANet), which consists of a stack of encoder blocks including self-attention and convolutional layers.

To better capture the context from a more expressive set of answers and understand the interactions between the question and the document, we utilized the coattention mechanism by encoding the two-way attention outputs together through a bidirectional reccurrent neural network (RNN). We experimented with enriching the embedding layer with concatenating character embeddings with existing word-level embedding, modifying the attention layer with coattention from Dynamic Coattention Networks (DCN), adding an Answer Pointer, which conditions the ending of the answer span on the starting position, to the output layer. Our best performing single model obtained F1/EM scores of 63.40/59.87, which both achieved better results than the baseline. Adding character embeddings and the answer pointer gave us a successful performance boost compared with the BiDAF baseline model. On the other hand, dynamic coattention from DCN did not beat the attention and modeling layer combined in the baseline BiDAF model but was worth trying.

We discovered that xEDA can help build a question answering system that is robust to shifts in domain distributions if few samples of out-of-domain datasets are available at train time. In particular, by applying xEDA to out-of-domain datasets during training, we were able to increase the performance of our question answering system by 6.1% in terms of F1 and by 14.9% in terms of EM when compared to the provided baseline on the dev set.

This robust question answering (QA) project aims to remedy this situation by using Reptile, a variant of meta learning algorithms. In this project, the primary goal is to implement Reptile algorithm for question answering tasks to achieve a better performance than the baseline model on the out-of-domain datasets. After the Reptile implementation is validated, the secondary goal of this project is to explore how various hyper parameters affect the final performance.  After we believe that the Reptile is optimally tuned, we worked on the data provided for this project. First, we merged in-domain validation dataset to the training data, then we added data augmentation to further tap into the potential of the out-of-domain training data. Training results of Reptile outperforms vanilla BERT model and Reptile with data augmentation increases the score even further. The best F1 score is 59.985 and best EM score is 42.225. If we compare the performance on out-of-domain validation dataset, scores are more than 12% and 22% higher than the baseline score respectively."

In our project, we have experimented with the a variant of the MAML algorithm, namely Reptile, in a low resource QA program. In contrast to the normal training procedure, MAML algorithm trains the model with a double-loop structure. In the inner loop, the program goes through meta-batches, with T tasks in each. For each of the tasks in the inner-loop, a submodel is made and updates k times. After the k descents have been made for T submodels, they are collected and processed in the Metalearner Reptile, where the next descent on the meta-model is determined. From the first glance of this training protocol, it appears to be similar to the multi-task learning model, since they both expose the model to multiple tasks, which enables transfer learning. Aside from that, one major distinction of MAML is that it makes use of the k th gradients, which enables the SGD to access higher order terms in the loss function, thereby allowing the MAML algorithm to find a better initialization than the other methods and descends at much rapid rate in any tasks in the downstream, as shown in figure (1). Furthermore, the reason MAML can find better model initialization than multi-task learning is that it can avoid overfitting to any one task, which is known to be a tendency in multi-task learning. In the end of the study, we introduce a cost-to-improvement ratio, evaluating whether the additional accuracy gain in MAML can justify the increase in runtime. Despite there is a absolute gain in the accuracy by MAML, we express our reservation in regard to the comparative advantage of MAML, since this 1 point increase in the accuracy comes at large sacrifice of runtime."

However, these models tend to learn domain specific features from the training data, and consequently perform poorly on other domain test data. In order to mend this issue, we adopt the adversarial training approach to learn domain invariant features in existing QA models. In this approach, the QA model tries to learn hidden features that the discriminator, which tries to classify the domain of the question-answer embedding from the hidden features, unsure of its prediction, thereby learning domain-invariant features. The intuition is that if the QA model can confuse the discriminator, then the features it has learned are not easily attributable to a specific domain. The QA model's loss depends on its own errors in answer prediction (the QA loss) as well as how well the discriminator predicts domain (the adversarial loss). We study modifications this model, in particular the impact of weights on the adversarial loss on the model's performance. We also study other techniques such as data augmentation and answer re-ranking in order to make our model more robust. Our work is limited in that we only train models on a subset of the training data available to us due to the cost of training time. However, we can conclude that changing the weight of the adversarial model results in marginal changes in performance. Furthermore, although the adversarial model exhibits improvements over our baseline, data augmentation proves to be a more effective technique in making the model robust on our of domain data given the subsampled training data."

The cross-domain Question Answering is challenging since QA models are usually not robust to generalize well on out-of-domain datasets. We would like to explore the effectiveness of domain-related information on QA model robustness. We leverage potential domain information, both domain-specific and domain-invariant, from the text data. During training on the in-domain training set, we explore the adversarial training by experimenting on three adversarial functions. We add a domain classifier to distinguish different domains. Meanwhile, the QA model fools the domain discriminator to learn domain-invariant feature representations from the in-domain training set. In addition to the domain-invariant learning from the in-domain training, we also propose a data augmentation method that can retain high-level domain information by using named entity recognition and synonyms replacement. Out -of-domain datasets are insufficient and we want to utilize them most. This augmentation method is applied on the oo-domain training set and we suppose that it will let the model learn domain specific information from the out-of-domain datasets.

These methods can boost the F1 score of a Transformer model on the SQuAD 2.0 task from (far below) 52.2 to just over 60.4 on a development set. However, the Transformer model relies mostly on textual similarity between the question and context, rather than on language understanding, to predict answers. The model still performs worse than a baseline BiDAF model, suggesting that the ability of current state-of-the-art training objectives and model architectures to learn effectively from limited data is still severely lacking. We hope that future methods, even with a general model architecture and objective, are able to perform well in a low-resource setting, and that this should also lead to approaches that learn more quickly, effectively, and generally by learning patterns, rather than correlations, that capture the meaning of language"

Because text data's discrete feature space, most data augmentation techniques require querying multiple systems for language knowledge and meticulous augmentation rule design by researchers. This paper aims to explore the effectiveness of an automatic, black-box data augmentation method using language models, bert context rewriter, and to compare it with another augmentation algorithm, token reorderer, which uses Universal Sentence Encoder's semantic knowledge.  Given a baseline question answering model, we employ DistilBERT masked language model (mlm) to rewrite masked context data and evaluate whether re-training with the augmented data can improve the robustness of the baseline model. This augmentation relies on the existing language knowledge learnt by DistilBERT mlm and does not use additional hand-crafted rules. We also explore how different configurations, including masked token percentage and additional mlm fine-tuning, affect our method's effectiveness. Preliminary experiments show that both our methods obtain improved performance on out-of-domain dev set over the baseline and reduce the performance gaps between in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. However, token reorderer's performance is consistently better than bert context rewriter's in both out-of-domain evaluation (+2.9 F1/+2.9 EM versus +1.9 F1/+1.6 EM) and reducing in-domain out-of-domain gaps (-5.3 F1/-4.8 EM versus -1.7 F1/-2.5 EM) and therefore is more effective in improving the baseline model's robustness."

If we have labeled data \"The project is too hard\". We first use GLoVE to find similar words and replace them with something like \"That work is super difficult\", which is our unlabeled data. Then for each word, we randomly select either from word from both data and have \"That work is too difficult\". Then we can linearly interpolate the labels for the mixed data for both mean square loss and cross-entropy loss. In this project, our experiments demonstrate that sequential order information does not necessarily help query-context matching, and excessive sequential order information in BiDAF's RNN can lead to overfitting. To alleviate overfitting and add more variety to the training samples, we propose four data augmentation methods without introducing non-negligible label noise, which improves the F1 scores of BiDAF and the QANet with 8 heads by at least 2 points. We also propose the Probability-Mixing method to prevent the model from memorizing the context, which significantly improves its ability in query-context matching. This method reduces the FPR from 0.3 to 0.18 and increases F1(TP) by 4 points for the QANet model, making it a much better model in preventing the generation of misleading information for the question-answering system."

In question answering, it has been successfully applied under many forms, especially with recurrent models (encoder-decoder fashion). Co-attention and multihead self-attention have been two interesting attention variations, but a larger study trying to combine them has never been conducted to the best of our knowledge. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to experiment different attention-based architecture types for question answering, as variations from one of the first successful recurrent encoder-decoder models for this task: BiDAF.  We implement a variation of the attention layer, starting with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, on both the query and the context tokens separately, as provided by the encoder layer. Then, these contextualized tokens, added to the input tokens through a skip connection, are passed to a trilinear cross-attention and used to compute two matrices: a context to query matrix and a context to query to context matrix. These two matrices are concatenated with the self-attended context tokens into an output matrix. In addition, we provide our model a character embedding, which proves to have an important positive impact on the performance, as well as a conditional output layer.

There has already been much study and development on how to accurately search for the correct answer of unanswered questions when the question is in the training domain. The usage of pretrained language models, such as ELMo, GPT, BERT, etc., enables knowledge gained from pretraining to be transferred to the new model. Although some models might outperform human performance for in-domain data, when it comes to out-of-domain data, they have poor performances. For the real world applications, we want a QA model to be able to both cover various domains and generalizes well on the out-of-domain data, hence the idea of domain generalization is proposed. For most of the current QA models, additional data is required to learn the new domains, and models tend to overfit on specific domains. Since it's impossible for a QA model to train on all domains, it's crucial to apply different techniques to build domain-agnostic QA models that can learn domain-invariant features instead of focusing on the specific features when there's limited training data.\n\nIn this project, we are given three types of in-domain datasets: SQuAD, Natural Questions, NewsQA, and three types of out-of-domain datasets: DuoRC, RACE, RelationExtraction. By reading through papers, we've learned different techniques, such as adversarial training, data augmentation, task-adaptive pretraining, etc., that might help with domain generalization. We first apply them individually on the given baseline model, DistilBERT, compare their F1 and EM scores, and analyze their performances. Then, we apply several combinations of the techniques, and further explore the performances of their combinations.

As a result, such models fail to generalize to other data, thus hampering performance in real-world cases where data is not independently and identically distributed (IID). Luckily, the use of domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT), which involves pretraining on unlabeled target domain data, and task-adaptive pretraining (TAPT), which entails pretraining on all of the unlabeled data of a given task, can dramatically improve performance on large models like RoBERTa when the original and target domain distributions have a small amount of overlap. Consistent with the Robust QA track of the default project, this report investigates and tests the hypothesis that TAPT in tandem with DAPT (also known as multi-phase adaptive pretraining, or MAPT) can improve performance on the target domain for smaller transformers like DistilBERT on the question answering task, especially in the presence of domain shift. The final results show that the use of TAPT can lead to a slight increase in Exact Match (EM) performance without DAPT. However, implementing DAPT, even with the use of word-substitution data augmentation, significantly degrades the performance of the model on the held-out target domain dataset."

My best model achieves a test score of (62.06 EM, 64.89 F1) compared to a baseline of (59.33, 62.09), reaching an optimal model in half the training steps."

In this project, the authors attempt to combine a few published methods to improve the robustness of the QA system on out-of-domain data. We have tried methods including domain adversarial training, domain adaptive pretraining, finetuning on few samples, and data augmentation. We applied these methods through experimentation, improving the robustness of our baseline model on out-of-domain test datasets given two groups of training datasets: three large in-domain datasets and three very small out-of-domain datasets. We experimented and evaluated the effects of the above-mentioned methods both individually and combined, and found that while the individual method generates mixed results, the combination of them can improve the robustness of the baseline model in the QA task to the greatest extent on the out-of-domain datasets. We have also included a qualitative analysis of our results, shedding some light on the real capabilities of our model."
