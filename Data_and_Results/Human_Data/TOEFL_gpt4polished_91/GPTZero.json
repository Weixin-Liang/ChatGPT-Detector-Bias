Firstly, I believe that it enables children to retain their learnings for an extended duration. The most effective method for children to assimilate a lesson is to repeatedly practice it at home. Ultimately, this approach contributes to enhanced academic achievement. Secondly, I contend that homework can foster parent-child bonding. For instance, I regularly received homework during my elementary school years. I would complete it alongside my parents and seek their assistance when encountering difficulties. Over time, this strengthened our bond significantly.",
