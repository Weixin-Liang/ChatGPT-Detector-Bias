With a computer, you can easily search for information on various topics, such as people's lives or specific subjects being studied in school or work. Additionally, computers can be utilized to save important files, including reports, pictures, and favorite websites. The ability to communicate with people who are far away is another advantage of computers. This can be done through email, social media, video chat, or online meetings. Overall, I think that computers are a great asset due to their ability to provide access to information, save important files, and facilitate communication.",

Moreover, people can use computers to stay in contact with family and friends who reside in different countries, and it's not as costly as long-distance calling.

With this in mind, people can learn more because they have more time to do so. This is significant since the more people learn, the better their future prospects will be. Finally, computers can enhance hand-eye coordination, which is essential for everyday activities such as driving and writing.

Firstly, computers are a great learning resource that helps one stay updated with the world. Secondly, computers provide an easy way to stay connected with friends and family. Clearly, computers do more good than harm for people, and without them, life would be different.\n\nComputers help us access information faster than ever. For instance, I can always look up something I need to know quickly, whether it's for @ORGANIZATION1 or my personal need. Thanks to Dr. @PERSON2's research from @ORGANIZATION1, it was found that high @ORGANIZATION1 students with computer access scored higher on standard testing due to background knowledge obtained online. @ORGANIZATION4 and @ORGANIZATION3 are some of the computer programs that help us learn new skills like language and writing.\n\nMoreover, computers keep us updated with current events happening around the world. For example, when the @LOCATION1 earthquake took place, I saw it first on the news, but it only provided limited details. Later, I searched online to know more details like the death toll, the aid provided, and ways I could donate. Without computers, I would have been uninformed.\n\nLastly, computers help us to stay connected with others. Facebook and @CAPS2 are some tools that let me chat with people, invite friends, and plan parties quickly. Research conducted by @ORGANIZATION5 shows that @PERCENT1 of people on social networking accounts have more active social lives than those who don't. Dr. @PERSON1 suggests this means that such people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations.\n\nIn conclusion, computers are a great benefit to society as they keep us informed, help us learn, and most importantly, keep us connected.

They provide people with various ways to research information quickly and easily, such as online tests or courses. They also provide a popular form of communication, such as email and instant messaging, which is useful for communicating with others.\n\nComputers can make life easier for adults too, as they can help with tasks such as paying bills, shopping, and job searching. Without computers, these tasks would require much more effort and time.\n\nIn conclusion, while some people argue that computers can be unhealthy, they generally do more good than harm.
