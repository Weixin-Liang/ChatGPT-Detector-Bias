With a computer, you can easily search for information on various topics, such as people's lives or specific subjects being studied in school or work. Additionally, computers can be utilized to save important files, including reports, pictures, and favorite websites. The ability to communicate with people who are far away is another advantage of computers. This can be done through email, social media, video chat, or online meetings.

Many children spend their time playing games, using MySpace, Facebook, and checking email after school instead of doing other things. Computers are fine in moderation, but spending all day on them is not healthy. Adults should not allow their children to spend all day on the computer, and they should not do it either because it can harm their lives. There are risks to putting pictures and information on the internet that can affect one's future, such as in job applications. Instead of spending time on the computer, people can go outside to do sports, learn new things, or plan family trips. Children's lives can also be affected by things they post on the internet, as it could lead to bullying or fights with others. Parents should be aware of sex offenders using the internet to deceive children or adults, and fake pictures can be used to lure them. It's important to be careful and not let computers negatively impact one's life."

I think computers are positive because they allow you to communicate with others online, learn new things easily, and improve hand-eye coordination. Firstly, computers are valuable because they give you the opportunity to communicate with people on the internet, even if you don't have a phone. It's simple to reach out if you need to. Moreover, people can use computers to stay in contact with family and friends who reside in different countries, and it's not as costly as long-distance calling. Keeping in touch with others is beneficial, and computers help with that. Secondly, computers enhance one's knowledge by offering a simple way to learn new things. It's no longer necessary to travel to gain new knowledge since one can learn virtually anything with the click of a button. With this in mind, people can learn more because they have more time to do so. This is significant since the more people learn, the better their future prospects will be. Finally, computers can enhance hand-eye coordination, which is essential for everyday activities such as driving and writing. Using computers helps people learn eye-hand coordination in a way that lasts their lifetime. In conclusion, I believe computers have a positive influence on people because they enhance communication, knowledge, and hand-eye coordination. Thank you for considering my views.",

This would be a problem, especially for young people, as we are the future, and an unhealthy society will suffer. Furthermore, studies show that exercising outdoors leads to increased energy levels and happiness, unlike computer use, which has been shown to cause headaches and fatigue. \n\nWe should encourage people, especially young ones, to spend more time playing outside instead of relying on technology too much. Parents can monitor their children by making them play outdoors with other kids. This will help them develop their natural instincts while avoiding overreliance on technology. \n\nAnother issue with technology is that it has reduced human interactions with others. These days people use texting, video calls, or chat to communicate. This may not be helpful as it could affect our ability to converse in real life. Moreover, families that rely on technology as their primary way of communication may harm their relationship. \n\nIn my opinion, using technology often is not recommended.

I believe computers are a useful resource that make everyday life easier. They help with learning and improving grades, and serve as a great teaching tool.\n\nOne way computers assist with learning is by making it easier to find information. For instance, instead of spending a lot of time looking for sources in a library, you can easily search online and find what you need in seconds.\n\nComputers can also be helpful for improving grades. Websites like Edline make it easy for teachers to post grades quickly.

I support computers because they help people learn about different cultures, save time, and allow communication with others online. For example, a man from the countryside who had never left his farm before was able to adapt to a new environment and find love with the help of a computer. Additionally, language students who use computers have higher success rates and better grades. Computers can also save time, like when a student was able to finish homework much faster with the help of an online dictionary. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate online, which is helpful for those who cannot leave their homes.

According to a recent university survey in @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 of respondents agreed that using laptop and computers has great benefits in their daily life. I personally agree with this statement as it allows us to interact with people worldwide, help with school work, and simplify daily tasks. For instance, when I moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3, I was able to stay in touch with my family and friends through emails, instant messages, and video calls without incurring high costs. Using a computer also makes mom's life easier as they can order food and shop online. Although some may argue that excessive computer usage is detrimental, if used reasonably, it can greatly benefit us in keeping connections, simplifying daily tasks, and research for school. Thank you."

Clearly, computers do more good than harm for people, and without them, life would be different.\n\nComputers help us access information faster than ever. For instance, I can always look up something I need to know quickly, whether it's for @ORGANIZATION1 or my personal need. Thanks to Dr. @PERSON2's research from @ORGANIZATION1, it was found that high @ORGANIZATION1 students with computer access scored higher on standard testing due to background knowledge obtained online. @ORGANIZATION4 and @ORGANIZATION3 are some of the computer programs that help us learn new skills like language and writing.\n\nMoreover, computers keep us updated with current events happening around the world. For example, when the @LOCATION1 earthquake took place, I saw it first on the news, but it only provided limited details. Later, I searched online to know more details like the death toll, the aid provided, and ways I could donate. Without computers, I would have been uninformed.\n\nLastly, computers help us to stay connected with others. Facebook and @CAPS2 are some tools that let me chat with people, invite friends, and plan parties quickly. Research conducted by @ORGANIZATION5 shows that @PERCENT1 of people on social networking accounts have more active social lives than those who don't. Dr. @PERSON1 suggests this means that such people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations.\n\nIn conclusion, computers are a great benefit to society as they keep us informed, help us learn, and most importantly, keep us connected.

For example, some people spend too much time chatting and gain weight. Others pretend to be someone else online and post false information. Also, people use computers to read instead of going to the library or bookstore, which could lead to the loss of these places.\n\nIt's better to exercise and enjoy life instead of spending too much time on the computer. We should be careful with online activities since not everyone is who they claim to be. Therefore, we need to reduce our dependence on electronics and remember the value of reading physical books.\n\nBest regards.",

Have you considered how a computer can help you physically?

Computers are an important part of a child's life if used properly. What's your primary method of learning? With a computer, you can look up almost anything with just a few clicks, which is especially helpful when you don't have access to books or a teacher. As a teen who attends school, I know that I couldn't do most of my assignments without my computer.

Using the computer too much can make loved ones worry about you and cause them to think differently of you. Staying on the computer all day can make it seem like you don't want to spend time with friends. When I was young, I used to be on the computer for days and even weeks until my family and friends encouraged me to stop. I had a friend who became addicted to the computer and it affected his personality and health.

They are especially useful at @ORGANIZATION1, where they help with homework and projects. By using a computer for research, it is faster and easier to complete a project. At @ORGANIZATION2, typing essays is easier and faster, which is helpful for students, especially those in higher grades. Computers can also be helpful in finding information, like directions or contact information, through websites such as yellow pages. They can also be used to book vacations and share pictures online. Additionally, computers can be used to connect with friends, play games, and talk to old friends through social media sites like @CAPS3. Even though a computer may get damaged, there are people who can fix it, and computers have reliable resources that are more up-to-date than books."
