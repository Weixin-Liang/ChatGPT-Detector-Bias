With a computer, you can easily search for information on various topics, such as people's lives or specific subjects being studied in school or work. Additionally, computers can be utilized to save important files, including reports, pictures, and favorite websites. The ability to communicate with people who are far away is another advantage of computers. This can be done through email, social media, video chat, or online meetings. Overall, I think that computers are a great asset due to their ability to provide access to information, save important files, and facilitate communication.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing. "

It's important for students to show appreciation to their parents and spend time with family. They should also put more effort into schoolwork instead of spending hours on social media. Only a small percentage of students use the internet for research. Many students struggle to complete homework on time. Students also need to exercise more instead of being lazy and spending all their time on the computer.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said \"you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic.\" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!

Some people think they are good because they can teach hand-eye coordination, help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. However, excessive computer use can have harmful side effects, such as obesity, red eyes, and cyberbullying. Many people who use computers too much are unhealthy and spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Computers are a major contributor to the obesity problem in @LOCATION1. They are also damaging people's eyesight, with some people experiencing strain and even blindness after only an hour of computer use. Cyberbullying is also a major problem, which can be experienced through video chat and messaging apps. I hope you will consider writing an article on this topic because computers are causing a variety of problems for society's health and mental well-being.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article. "

You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along.

People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun? "

If a child, or anyone @CAPS3 on the computer and a family member thinks it @CAPS3 an unreasonable amount of time, that sounds like it @CAPS3 just an issue between the person and his or her family.

Some people @MONTH1 like the old ways, but personally. I like the freedom and easiness of a computer. Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary @CAPS3 helpful. Yes a thesauris @CAPS3 helpful but there are separate things. Compared to a computer those classic research tools are still usefull, but could be a hassle. My point @CAPS3 a computer has a dictionary thesauris, encyclipedea...ect all in @NUM1! So next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard @CAPS4 of the bookshelf! To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a Family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized, but became more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our scociety, without computers, space travel for example would not be the normality it seems to be in this generation. All im trying to say @CAPS3, I don't think computers hurt our society, but are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world. A computer @CAPS3 a help learning tool, the king of all reaserch tools and a big part of our society today.If you could learn one thing from reading this paper, I would want you to think, \"@CAPS5 would we, as a world be without computers?\" "

An average american goes on a computer for about @NUM1 hours a day. With going to work or school, and sleeping, that way leaves a litle @NUM2 to go out and explore nature. Our national parks @NUM3's have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate. I visited yellow stone last week to find out if as many people have been goind. The man who works at the entrance was saying that \"since the start of @DATE1 alone about @PERCENT1 less people have been to @LOCATION1,\" I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from goind to parks or to zoo's, by consuming the public time with all of the \"new fashion\" or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exersize. With the newest \"sims game,\" how are kick supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hour kids spend on thier computer and out of the people who said more than @NUM4 minutes. @PERCENT2 of them could legally considered obease. Is that now we want our next gerneration to be out next president and lawyers, and doctors? @CAPS8, we want them to live life to the @CAPS4 by taking care of themselves by exersizing. Computers are getting kids so consumed that is not ok. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each another @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, or interact with each other at all i mean sure, parents come home to thier child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends? @CAPS2 to @CAPS2 he said that well since he got his new \"@CAPS5 @CAPS6 with a @NUM5 gig hardrive\", he hadn't been talking to them a whole @CAPS2 to @CAPS2. However, everyday we went on \"chat\" \"for a good @NUM6 hours\", to talk to his friends. And only occasionally would he get an @CAPS7-mail or two from his asking how his days was. I do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life. That is what @LOCATION3 has come down to computers. They limit you from interacting to friends and family, give you less time to exersize and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe at this time in @NUM7 years, @LOCATION3 will be run by computer. Do we want that, @CAPS8! so lets put a stop to it now. Thank you very much! "

There are risks to putting pictures and information on the internet that can affect one's future, such as in job applications. Instead of spending time on the computer, people can go outside to do sports, learn new things, or plan family trips. Children's lives can also be affected by things they post on the internet, as it could lead to bullying or fights with others.

First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it.

Without hand-eye cordinatoin how are you supose to hit a ball coming at you with a bat, how are you supose to catch a ball with your hands? The second reason is you can learn about far away places and people.

I think computers are positive because they allow you to communicate with others online, learn new things easily, and improve hand-eye coordination. Firstly, computers are valuable because they give you the opportunity to communicate with people on the internet, even if you don't have a phone. It's simple to reach out if you need to. Moreover, people can use computers to stay in contact with family and friends who reside in different countries, and it's not as costly as long-distance calling. Keeping in touch with others is beneficial, and computers help with that. Secondly, computers enhance one's knowledge by offering a simple way to learn new things. It's no longer necessary to travel to gain new knowledge since one can learn virtually anything with the click of a button. With this in mind, people can learn more because they have more time to do so. This is significant since the more people learn, the better their future prospects will be. Finally, computers can enhance hand-eye coordination, which is essential for everyday activities such as driving and writing. Using computers helps people learn eye-hand coordination in a way that lasts their lifetime.

This illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people dont have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch, it also wont cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. "

Firstly, using computers keeps people indoors and deprives them of fresh air. They can go outside and observe wildlife if they are interested in studying it. Secondly, using computers causes physical inactivity leading to weight gain and laziness. One should take breaks and indulge in physical activities like walking, running, cycling or working out. Lastly, people should connect with family and friends instead of being glued to the computer. One can plan family outings and spend quality time with loved ones. Excessive use of computers can lead to isolation and depression. In conclusion, we must prioritize people over screens and enjoy the world beyond our devices.",

The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature. "

Computers help us with work, school, and even buying a house or car online. They are inexpensive and useful for looking up information, playing games, and staying connected with the world. Some things, like playing Xbox Live and certain homework or college requirements, can only be done on a computer. Although some people waste time on computers, they save time and make things easier. I believe that computers are very beneficial and versatile. What do you think?",

This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion? "

Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it. "

Due to technology, people are often distracted and avoid exercising, leading to an unhealthy lifestyle. This would be a problem, especially for young people, as we are the future, and an unhealthy society will suffer. Furthermore, studies show that exercising outdoors leads to increased energy levels and happiness, unlike computer use, which has been shown to cause headaches and fatigue. \n\nWe should encourage people, especially young ones, to spend more time playing outside instead of relying on technology too much. Parents can monitor their children by making them play outdoors with other kids. This will help them develop their natural instincts while avoiding overreliance on technology. \n\nAnother issue with technology is that it has reduced human interactions with others. These days people use texting, video calls, or chat to communicate. This may not be helpful as it could affect our ability to converse in real life. Moreover, families that rely on technology as their primary way of communication may harm their relationship. \n\nIn my opinion, using technology often is not recommended.

I have also heard that people believe in the tecnology. So, the reason why I'm writing today is about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family. Now that are new technology with computers and such, people are distracted and do not want to exercise. This will effect our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy and sluggish all the time. @PERSON1 we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that its good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @CAPS2 all the time is because @CAPS1 has been proven you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer. Exercise won't do that at all. Sence all of our new technology with @CAPS2 and other gagits people really don't go outside play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic and she said, \"@CAPS4 these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at @NUM1 am and I wouldn't be back home until around @NUM2 pm.\" I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their @CAPS4 and have them run around the neigborhood with other @CAPS4. If we did this more offtine maybe @CAPS4 and adults too. will just do this naturally and will not have to relie on computers or @CAPS5 for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea @PERSON1? My last topic is with computers and cellphone and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Now a days Friends aim, video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also is someone aims or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face. Lastly I know familys that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their get off their emails and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a health relationship with family members. @PERSON1 I really hope I have persuade to you that technology is only ok to use sometime and not very day. Remember technology is bad because we don't exerce, play outside and enjoy nature and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time. "

There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that do. Computers can give you the answer to any question. When my mom was little she didn't have access to a computer all the time. @CAPS1 when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know. If they didn't know the answer than she couldn't know the answer. If more people had computers then they would the to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people.

Computers have of folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays next all on the computer. My friend just get a computer for her office.

Computers can help us in so many ways including making learning easier, helps students do better in @CAPS4, nad serves as a great teaching tool. One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask hao a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, @CAPS1 sounds crazy, but its true! Let's say you're a middle @CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; @CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just google search what your topic in and @CAPS3! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, prettty cool right? Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you @CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @CAPS4? That's right, computers allow students to do better in @CAPS4. Websites such as edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz your treacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with things like absentees, weekends and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get @CAPS1 back @CAPS1's time for a chapter test with @PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you didn't do @CAPS2 on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do @CAPS2 on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before , you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @CAPS2 on the test. As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, @CAPS1 just seems like there are speaking another language? @CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on youtube explaining @CAPS1? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because @CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you understand why computers are useful, now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool.

Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination. Study's show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination. I'm sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into @CAPS2 and make thier status all about thier win. Plus, they probably pull up pingball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand eye coordination? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home I mean @CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library you would have to first get there, secend pick out your book, and third check @CAPS1 out. with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is because @CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I @CAPS3 I do. I can't always call them on the phone @CAPS4 I want to talk to them so I just log on to @CAPS2 and if there online I can have my conversation with that person. I don't @CAPS3 about you but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortanitly she doesn't even live anywhere close to @NUM1 hours to me. She's way down @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. By car thats one and a half days and by plane thats three hours! So @CAPS1's so much easier to log on @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So in conclusion I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just amazing! They help you get hand eye coordination, let you research something super quick, and let you stay in touch with far away friends and family. "

My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if its a small school if there are alot of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there. hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your geting the feeling when you use it and your geting faster at typing. Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboark brings there @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. in conclusion I dont think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading thise I hope you agree with me.

This can lead to health problems such as arthritis and seizures. Some experts believe that computers are causing obesity and that computer games can be particularly addictive. Using computers excessively can also make people feel depressed and isolated. It's important to remember to spend time away from the computer and appreciate nature. Additionally, computers can be expensive, especially when paying for things like online games and internet bills. Overall, while computers can be useful, it's important to use them in moderation and prioritize other things in our lives.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they\u0092ve really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers. Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're adicted to facebook. Also money will always be less when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to you health! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know, more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics? Dr. @LOCATION1 is as saying \"People don't cause obesity, computers do\" @CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk, and felt great? Well a lot of people tell on rely on thier computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When on twitter, facebook, google and you tube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things. For example if you're a parent your child might feel abandonned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alchohol or smoking. I let you never of a computer like that! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when youre addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that youre not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids websites like webking which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket. To me computers are just a trouble in our lives. "

Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the @CAPS2.S.A but even in other countrys! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I @MONTH1 have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and its a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry. "

I think they have a positive impact on people as they improve hand-eye coordination, provide access to knowledge, and allow for communication. Hand-eye coordination is important in sports and driving, and using computer games like Lumosity can help train and develop this skill. Computers also provide a way to learn and gather information about various subjects using search engines like Google. Additionally, computers offer communication options like instant messaging and email, which can be especially helpful for those without phones or for long-distance communication. Overall, I believe computers have many positive effects on society.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects. "

Everything you can get from a computer can also be found in books. Secondly, the constant use of computers means having to pay high electricity and internet bills.

And finaly @CAPS2 reason is because of the \"@CAPS8 crises.\" @CAPS2 first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. I belive this because of your electric bill and and @CAPS3 bill. The people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true becuse of the constant charging of laptops or running of computors. Also they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that bocome a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the dawn. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I belive this because where do you think the website makers get there info from. Reading books also increase your knoledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this \"@CAPS8 crisis.\" @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This I cause less people to be phisicaly active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crises and computor are sadly con triputing to the world wide crisis. I eagerly hope that @CAPS2 letter hase helped you see @CAPS2 point of view on this subject.

Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just \"happen\" to get lost, try going on @ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way.

For example, a man from the countryside who had never left his farm before was able to adapt to a new environment and find love with the help of a computer. Additionally, language students who use computers have higher success rates and better grades. Computers can also save time, like when a student was able to finish homework much faster with the help of an online dictionary. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate online, which is helpful for those who cannot leave their homes.

        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. \"@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11.\" @CAPS15 her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have and @CAPS11 @NUM2. @CAPS8 would have just kept failing @CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does @CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, @CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer. "

For example, many people in the @LOCATION1 have half of their day to computers, and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers. This is @CAPS1 affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends. For example, I used to be friends a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @DATE1 to the computer. Since this helped I have been over to his house about @NUM3 times this year as to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1 way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers. In my mind I that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers, but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers. In your so you and your family members don't loose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time on computers to the whole day on them. "

        "document": "Dear @ORGANIZATION2 editor, \n\nI am writing to share my opinion about whether computers are good or bad for society. I think computers are helpful for several reasons. Firstly, computers are a great learning resource that helps one stay updated with the world. Secondly, computers provide an easy way to stay connected with friends and family. Clearly, computers do more good than harm for people, and without them, life would be different.\n\nComputers help us access information faster than ever. For instance, I can always look up something I need to know quickly, whether it's for @ORGANIZATION1 or my personal need. Thanks to Dr. @PERSON2's research from @ORGANIZATION1, it was found that high @ORGANIZATION1 students with computer access scored higher on standard testing due to background knowledge obtained online. @ORGANIZATION4 and @ORGANIZATION3 are some of the computer programs that help us learn new skills like language and writing.\n\nMoreover, computers keep us updated with current events happening around the world. For example, when the @LOCATION1 earthquake took place, I saw it first on the news, but it only provided limited details. Later, I searched online to know more details like the death toll, the aid provided, and ways I could donate. Without computers, I would have been uninformed.\n\nLastly, computers help us to stay connected with others. Facebook and @CAPS2 are some tools that let me chat with people, invite friends, and plan parties quickly. Research conducted by @ORGANIZATION5 shows that @PERCENT1 of people on social networking accounts have more active social lives than those who don't. Dr. @PERSON1 suggests this means that such people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations.\n\nIn conclusion, computers are a great benefit to society as they keep us informed, help us learn, and most importantly, keep us connected. Therefore, computers are a very positive influence in our lives.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reason. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reason I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently preformed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that, \"@CAPS1 with access to computers scored signficantly better on standard testing due to background information they have accquired while on line\". Along with the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4, and @ORGANIZATION3, which help people to learn a new language, or write on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devestated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I the looked it up on line and imediatly get the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. With things like facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individualy, but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercize. Also, things like @CAPS3 and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies done by @ORGANIZATION5 show that @PERCENT1 of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not according to doctor @PERSON1 this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than these who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit. In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socialy capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing. "

Secondly, they enable us to connect with people from different places, and lastly, they help us to learn more about the world we live in.\n\nWith a few clicks, computers can provide us with information that we would have spent hours searching for in the library. Additionally, they allow us to talk to people from faraway places and even share videos and games with them. Moreover, we can use a computer to find out news, weather patterns, and learn about different cultures worldwide.\n\nAt the end of the day, computers are essential tools that improve our lives in many ways. Therefore, I urge you to consider the benefits of computers and their impact on society.\n\nSincerely, [Your Name]",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a \"@CAPS1 @CAPS2\" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives. "

I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entetainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixty-three percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, everytime I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devistation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are! "

Finally, while computers can help you learn about different cultures and places, it's better to travel there or meet people from those places to experience it firsthand.

My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click onm something for long period of time, can cause arthrities. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them. Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example: @CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, @CAPS2 you get a computers, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it's amazing right! WRONG! before you know if, it's the day for the family get together and your line an hour @CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come. And that breaks you family's heat....My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But its ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place @CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck, back and sore @CAPS3 I right, I think I @CAPS3. Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers.(To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) @CAPS4 therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health, it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and @NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study its yourself instead of going on a computers for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, hoe computers have bad effects on people who use it a lott, and take action into their own hands and do what is right. "

People who hike and really enjoy being outside are @PERCENT1 smarter than people who don't. I like being outside more than inside and I have straight A's. Sports are also a good way to get outside. My favorite sport is baseball and I am pretty good. Some places say that computers can help with your hand-eye-coordination, but how can a computer help you with that? Sports are what help you with hand-eye coordination. Playing sports can also help you get stronger. Baseball is why I can bench press @NUM1 pounds. @PERCENT2 of kids who play a sports are not over weight, but @PERCENT3 of kids who don't are. Traveling is also a good way to get outside. I love traveling. I am fluent in english french, and spanish. My favorite place to go is northern @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1. Computers can show you pictures of a place, but when you are actually there, it is really fascinating. A picture on a computer cannot even compare to what it is really like. You also cannot walk on a computer, or drink the water from a stream, or climb up a clift. There is really no comparison. Computers are alot worse and alot worse for real nature. Compared to real life and nature, there really is no comparison. Computers aren't as good as real life. You can enjoy nature playsports, an travel the world, all by just being outside.

        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. \"if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,\" say @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. \"@CAPS1\" @CAPS2 says \"They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people.\" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all. "

You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldent have to drive all the doun there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her.

If you didet hav a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances. A lot of people work on the computer to save the envirment. When I grow up I\u0092ll probaly work on the computer because it is easer. That is why I think that you can work on the computer.

They provide people with various ways to research information quickly and easily, such as online tests or courses. They also provide a popular form of communication, such as email and instant messaging, which is useful for communicating with others.\n\nComputers can make life easier for adults too, as they can help with tasks such as paying bills, shopping, and job searching. Without computers, these tasks would require much more effort and time.\n\nIn conclusion, while some people argue that computers can be unhealthy, they generally do more good than harm. They help with education, communication, and make life easier for adults. I hope this explanation has made my point clear and you agree with me.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me.

Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable. "

With a computer, you can see and talk to them through a camera, just as if you were there. \n\nThere are many other reasons why computers are important. Firstly, they provide information about new places and cultures for those who want to explore. Secondly, people in important jobs need computers to save their work and access important data. Finally, computers help with organization, allowing people to keep all their important documents in one place.\n\nAs you can see, computers are not just a way to pass the time, but instead can be used productively in many ways.

Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it.

It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends.

You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone.

When I was @NUM2 I use to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer, it was like I was a brat. Also I used to be big, (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or in my own room.

Also when he did come outside he used to never do nothing or run because he was always @CAPS1 tired, @CAPS1 what I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad way's. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computer's can do now. For example, a game called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 can get you addicted @CAPS1 fast, you barely do anything elese. Another bad thing is @CAPS4, sure you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it.

Well I just gave you a little thing of a lot of thing's a computer can do but to refresh your memory I'll say it again.

For instance I am always outsided hanginaround when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on facebook, but during the @DATE1 there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight we'll if you'de get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is @NUM1 lbs. at the age of @NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1 I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy a expensive computer and motem and all that expensive technological accesories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in thes essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definately doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyones life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer.  "

Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way.

Computers run people's relationships with family and friend. @NUM5 year old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spen time with this @CAPS8. Kids don't organize their priorities we enough. as it is, adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. Peple have accounts on social networking sites like facebook and sometimes they are very drame filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy vidoes than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family. People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain healthyness before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of naturel, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. The cause stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computer have a negative affect on people. "

        "document": "A study found that many people spend too much time on computers and it has caused problems for society. Some people believe that computers are not beneficial for people. I agree because computers make people spend less time outside and miss the beauty of nature. They also make people communicate less with their families and take away time for exercise, which can lead to health problems.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. \"@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,\" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. \"The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make. "

Spending too many hours in front of computers can take away from time that could be spent with friends or enjoying the outdoors. Computers can also take away from real-life communication skills. In conclusion, computers can negatively impact our lives and limit our experiences. Additionally, typing for long periods of time can cause arthritis in your hands.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, @CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me \" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?\" and i answer \"@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3.\" @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than @CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It @MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much. "

It's important for people to be active and not just sit in front of a computer, which can cause weight gain.

Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1 or \"The studies of the human mind\" says \"I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people.\" That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous. "

Can you picture @CAPS1 person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the @CAPS1 @DATE1? Just ask eye @PERSON1,\" @CAPS1 year I get and more people coming to the eye doctors. You might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer it erodes you eye-sight over time. \"@CAPS2, many people wear glasses now more then ever. @DATE1 @DATE1 in the local newspaper, they had a chart that showed how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from computers. It went up almost @PERCENT2 from @DATE1 year and @PERCENT3 from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses. Have you looked outside lately? Have you notice that @DATE2 is coming and there is leaves on the tree now? If you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then I doubt you were. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer how out it isn't a @NUM1 job. In that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun. @DATE1 year I wanted to play catch with my dad, but was on his old computer doing what he does. I didn't want to play alone so I just stayed inside and went on my computer for the day. Do you want that to happen to @CAPS1 person, everyday I wouldn't. Yes, people would rather be a couch potatoe and chat online, eating a bug of a million junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while slaying fit, but now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese. People sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood from stearing at the monitor for hours. But why do you than you @MONTH1 ask, it is because they never some outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can higher your chances of getting different cancers.

Computers also allow people to read news without buying a newspaper and provide a live feed of what is happening in the world.

People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world.

People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world.

        "document": "Hi @PERSON2, your recent article on the positives and negatives of computers in our society was informative. However, I think you missed some important reasons why technology can do more harm than good. Firstly, the health issues associated with computers, including obesity-related heart disease and diabetes, are on the rise. Secondly, despite the internet seeming like a great place to socialize, it can actually cause people to lose friends as it is easy to lose social skills and spend too much time communicating online without meeting in person. Please consider these points before using your laptop, as your health and friendships are important. Thank you for reading this letter.",
        "prompt": "Simplify word choices as if written by a non-native speaker.  \n\n Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consiquences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especally computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that \"@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes.\" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 then go for a bikeride or play a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone elipses that could leave them paralized for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important, to you that its worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet @MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends insted of making them. I know what your thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' @CAPS7, really. Since its so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face-to-face, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, its so hard to know if your actually close friends. Because of this, they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they dont even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @CAPS2? Next time feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' @CAPS8 call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter. "
