Because I can buy the things needed for cooking, and I can make sure that they are clean and fresh. Second, making a good dinner helps me obtain a sense of achievement. On every Spring festival, I always make dinner for my whole family, they always think that the meal is delicious and we can chat freely around the table. I am really proud of it and I think it can improve the relationship between my family and me."

There are a couple of reasons to name. The first reason I wanna say is it\u2019s beautiful, when I\u2019m free, I can walk in the woods, smell the grass and flowers, listen to the birds singing, all of these make me feel relaxed. The second reason is there are a lot of foreigners, so I can make friends with them, we can have a get together, we discuss, we talk, we laugh, all of these make my life funny.

If you are only driven by profit, it's likely that you will abandon your current subject once it seems not so profitable, and that's clearly not good for the development of science."

First, families used to get together after dinner and talk about their day, to share their joy and sorrow, to play games and have fun. But now, the only thing they do now is sitting in the couch, watching TV for entertainment. And second, working out is a much better choice than watching TV. Obesity and heart attack are now very serious problems in this country, a major cause of it is that people like to sit in front of TV all day and eat junk food."

This little watch is of very special meaning to me because it always reminds me of those days I spent in a beautiful French town located by the beach. My watch is deep blue, as blue as the charming ocean view on the beach. You know how romantic it can ever be, just relax yourself on the beach, when the sun is setting down, when the ocean breeze is blowing and the seabirds are singing. The most important, I made friends with some gorgeous French girls. One of them gave me this little watch as a gift. I cherish the watch just as much as we cherish our friendship. "

So I walked with them every day after work, asking about their culture, and introducing China to them. And I was grateful that they are really nice people, they helped me a lot.

In addition, the big city can provide us a plenty of internship opportunities to me. Moreover, jobs in big cities can offer more decent salary. So that's why I think big city is more attractive for me to study."

He said that Allen was just super diligent. He was always the first person that arrived for the training, and always the last one to leave.

In addition, having a higher education will give you an advantage over the other candidates applying for the same job.

For one thing, the beauty of vacation rests on our excitement, the excitement to plan trips, to spend time with loved ones or so on. But too long a vacation will only gradually consume the excitement. And finally you will be boring, so the rest of the vacation will be totally wasted. And also, people need to release their stresses once in a while, you can't expect them to do that once a year, it's likely that they will snap at some point. So I don't think taking a long vacation once a year is a good choice."

But most of high school graduates know few things, what they really need is to study, to gain knowledge for their future.

Secondly, I think watching the news every day can be a waste of time. Like, if I spend an hour every day watching a news broadcast I just don't have enough time for more important things.

In addition, it is more important to save money and pay off your debts, rather than waste your money on something useless. So for these two reasons, I would save a small amount of money."

First, since superior staff can\u2019t sit it on every class, they should take input from the students on how the class went. Students are likely to be honest in their reviews, so the professor can also learn from their mistakes. However, I believe that there are disadvantages as well. If a student knows that they will receive a failing grade, they may be dishonest in their review just to spite the professor. They may say that the professor wasn\u2019t fair, even if that isn\u2019t true. This can be hurtful to the professor and detrimental to their career. So, I believe that there are advantages and disadvantages to asking students to evaluate their professors at the end of the semester."

For example, when parents lie to their kids that Santa Claus exists, their children will behave well for the whole year because they want to receive good presents from Santa. In addition, the other person may not really want to hear your honest answer anyway. For instance, when an overweight girl asks a guy if she is fat, she may want to hear the other person say \u201cNo, you are skinny.\u201d In situations like this, it is better to lie.

Second, I am not very interested in sciences, so I don\u2019t think an energy and environment or solar system class would be very intriguing to me.

For example, when you do homework with your friends, you can chat with them when you get tired or feel bored, and this will help you relax and become more focused on your work later. As another reason, I prefer doing homework with others because we can engage in discussions. For instance, homework is very difficult sometimes. If you get stuck on a question, you can ask your friends who are doing the same homework, and these homework discussions will help you understand the concept and answer questions on your homework. For these reasons, I prefer to do homework with others."

First of all, our personal phones are the only way for us to hear about emergencies affecting our loved ones.  And this is something we want to hear about as soon as humanly possible.  You know, if a worker feels nervous about being out of touch with his loved ones during the day, he might actually start looking around for a job that lets him use his phone and this would be really bad for business. Secondly, I think personal phones can maybe improve our morale at work.  We can relieve our stress by making a quick phone call or looking at a social media post.

First of all, it is not the responsibility of schools to completely eliminate all risk from the lives of students. Otherwise, they would have to abolish any science labs that used chemicals or sharp objects because they pose a potential threat to safety. Furthermore, students and their families should be allowed to make personal decisions about what kind of activities they are participating in despite risk as long as they are not simultaneously endangering unknowing bystanders. Therefore, I firmly believe that schools should allow students to make decisions about what sports they will play, even when those sports contain some serious risks."

Secondly, if we don't like the result of our surgery we can always change it back.  I mean, plastic surgery is really affordable these days, so if you get some surgery and it looks bad\u2026 you can just get another procedure done.  For instance, I've changed my nose about six times already, and the expense to me has been pretty minimal."

Compared to individual efforts, governmental regulations make citizens follow the law, rather than make good choices. For example, in Korea, if you don\u2019t recycle properly, you can receive a fine. They provide all the bins and resources to make it easy for the public to make the right choice to recycle. Second, when the government steps in to make regulations, it also educates the public, which can lead to individuals going above and beyond for the environment. When the government introduces a new regulation, it will explain why they are doing it, which may have people think twice about before they throw garbage out the window of the car. For these two reasons, I believe that governmental regulations have the biggest impact on environmental protection."

The range of museums is fantastic\u2014there are museums of ancient history and archaeology, of natural history and even museums for such things as transportation and crime! And because the museums often hold new exhibitions, there is always something different to see. Theaters offer people a big place to enjoy a variety of operas and plays of different regions. Meanwhile, the building of the museums and theaters will enhance the cultural exchange between countries. They are also one of the contributing factors that promote the national economy. That's why I think it's a good idea for government to help with the building of museums and theaters."

For example, if I wanted to get some exercise, but I only played team sports, I\u2019d, uhh, I\u2019d have to call friends or, I don\u2019t know\u2014or find a group of people who played regularly. But on the other hand, if I want to go running, I can just go any time. Also, I can listen to music while running or hiking. You need to talk to communicate when playing a team sport, so you can\u2019t do that\u2026 you can\u2019t wear headphones at all. In general, I guess I just like exercising alone better, because I have more control of when and what I do."

They are fun, they are relatively easy to understand, and most importantly, I loved to adventure with the heroes in the novels. When I grow up, I start to seek the wisdom in those novels, to find out what the authors really want to say behind the words. I grow so emotional attached to the people in the stories. I began to share their joy and sorrow. And I've learned so much from them."

First, from the news broadcasting in the television, we can know what is happening in the outside world even without stepping out our living room with television in it. And second, watching television with family members after supper is a good way to relax after a hard day's work. What's more, its visual effect makes people feel less stressed and has a great influence on the way people think and talk. "

He should not tell stories behind my back\u037e he should tell me my short-comings at my mouth, but never praises me in front of me. It is a well known saying that A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED. Therefore, a friend should stand by you in the hour of any sort of need. I just think that a good friend won't leave me if I'm in trouble. They can be my friends in sunshine and in shade, care for me even when the times are bad and even more when the times are great. Also, I'd love to spend more time with someone who can make me laugh and is fun to be around."

For example, in my senior year I had a history class where I worked on a major assignment with five different students.  While working on the assignment, I had to handle scheduling and I even had to deal with interpersonal-conflict between different members of the group.  Both of these things taught me skills that I use almost every day in my career now. Secondly, group projects simply have better outcomes.  Group projects benefit from the expertise of many different people.  As a result, the final project is usually of a higher quality than a student would complete on their own."

They simply have a lot more in common with them in terms of personal interests and pop culture awareness.  As a result, it's easier for them to connect the classroom material to the real lives of the students.  This can encourage kids to stay motivated and keep on task for their whole school day. Secondly, younger teachers have a lot more energy.  Class sizes are huge now.  In fact, they're probably bigger than ever before.  This can create trouble for older teachers who might run out of energy and not be able to finish their lessons if they have a huge group of students."

In addition, I will spend my money because I want to take good care of myself and make sure that I don\u2019t get sick. With only a small amount of money left, I know that I won\u2019t have the money to pay for medical bills if I get really sick and have to go to the hospital.
