The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the gating mechanism used for context word selection in the context of extractive question answering. The experimentation was conducted utilizing a Transformer-based architecture equipped with an attention mechanism that can isolate essential context information. The findings reveal that employing fine-grained gating significantly enhances answer accuracy, outclassing the state-of-the-art models on SQuAD 2.0 leaderboard in F1 score. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the model's attention weights is carried out to discern the crucial role of different words in the context during final answer generation.

Adversarial attacks are alterations in input data that mislead machine learning models into producing incorrect predictions. In this study, we propose an altered adversarial training method to reinforce question answering models against adversarial attacks. Our approach involves integrating adversarial examples within the training process to enhance the model's capability to identify and withstand adversarial attacks. Empirical findings illustrate that our method exceeds the baseline system in generalization and robustness; thus, it is viable in potentially enhancing other natural language processing tasks to protect against adversarial attacks.

Additionally, the effectiveness of the MoE model in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is analyzed, and the results indicate that the MoE model's diversified skills improve OOD performance relative to single models.

However, the success of such systems is highly dependent on their adaptability to diverse input texts. This report presents a method for constructing a resilient QA system through the use of diverse backtranslation. Our technique involves translating the source text into multiple languages followed by back-translating them into the original language. We then implement a scoring mechanism to determine the most suitable translations and employ a QA model which is trained on this diverse dataset of back-translated text. Our study exhibits an improvement in QA precision, specifically for low-resource languages. Our method can be exploited to create more comprehensive and reliable QA systems, notably for languages that are frequently disregarded by current solutions.",

Out-domain data augmentation blends related data from other domains with the training set to enhance the model's ability to generalize. The outcomes indicate that both techniques considerably enhance the performance and durability of the question answering system, with the most favorable outcomes resulting from combining these two approaches.

The outcomes demonstrate that the Probability-Mixing method surpasses most of the current methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score, indicating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning for question-answering tasks. This final report introduces a new technique for semi-supervised learning in question-answering tasks, which involves combining two models' outputs, namely a supervised model and a self-training model. This self-training model is trained on unlabeled data using data augmentation techniques to generate more diverse examples.
