        "prompt": "Elevate the provided text by employing advanced technical language: \n\n \n\nThe SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) is a challenging task and the attention mechanism has become a popular technique for its solution. One of the proposed models for SQuAD is the Gated Self-Attention (GSA) model. The GSA utilizes a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) to encode the contexts and query-words into a sequence of hidden states. These states are then used to calculate the self-attention matrix, and the query-aware context representation. The result of the GSA is then passed through a linear layer to obtain the final answers. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the GSA model on the SQuAD dataset and provide insights into the performance, limitations, and possible future directions for improvement.
